User Guide (Keep Updating_):
	up to 11.16.2017, all you need to do is run the wallflower_pico_server.py as LAB5. To send data to the server, please interact with the file send2server.py, be careful of the stream_id and stream_shorthand.
	up to 11.26.2017, you can go into different streams and view their plots. Also a more detailed plot is generated under the tab "Trip."
	up to 11.28.2017, you need to start two local host, one for the wallflower server and one for the google api. By defaul the port is 5000 and 8000 respectively. I have also added dynamic interactions to the google map route show case. Check it out have fun.
